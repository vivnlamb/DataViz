#DuBoischallenge 

I am replicating the data visualizations in R Programming Language, in R Studio. I selected Challenge 1, Plate 7, because it appears deceptively simple:
- I am visualizing the data as close to the illustration by W.E.B. Du Bois. This required creative customizations using the ggplot2 library. 
- I am using R programming language as an additional challenge, because I mainly code in Python, and have only used R once for Latent Class Analysis.
- The R library ggplot2 allows data visualization customization, while Tableau does not provide options for dashed lines.
